# ACAP Deployment - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Architecture Detection**
- Automatically detects camera architecture via VAPIX:
  - `/axis-cgi/param.cgi?action=list&group=Properties.System.Architecture`
  - Shows architecture (aarch64/armv7hf) and firmware version in camera list
- Smart build selection based on detected architecture

### 2. **Build Selection**
- Shows all available builds (.eap files) for each release
- Auto-selects matching architecture when possible
- Manual selection dialog when needed with "Recommended" tag

### 3. **VAPIX Deployment**
- Uses official VAPIX Application API endpoints:
  - **Upload**: `/axis-cgi/applications/upload.cgi`
  - **Start**: `/axis-cgi/applications/control.cgi?action=start`
  - **Status**: `/axis-cgi/applications/list.cgi`
- Proper digest authentication implementation
- Progress tracking during upload

### 4. **Post-Deployment Features**
- **Automatic app start**: Ensures ACAP is running after upload
- **Status verification**: Checks app is actually running
- **Direct camera link**: Shows "Open Camera Apps" button
- **URL**: `http://{camera-ip}/camera/index.html#/apps`

## UI Enhancements

### During Deployment
```
✓ Deployment successful! ACAP is running.
[Open Camera Apps] → Opens http://192.168.50.156/camera/index.html#/apps
```

### Camera List
- Shows architecture and firmware for each camera
- Deploy button with status tracking
- Success indicator with app link

## Workflow

1. **Select Release** → Shows all builds (aarch64.eap, armv7hf.eap)
2. **Discover Cameras** → Auto-detects architecture
3. **Set Credentials** → Tests with digest auth
4. **Deploy** → 
   - Downloads from GitHub
   - Auto-selects correct architecture build
   - Uploads via VAPIX
   - Starts application
   - Verifies running status
   - Shows camera apps link

## Technical Implementation

### IPC Flow
- Frontend: `window.electronAPI.deployACAP(params)`
- Preload: Routes to `deploy-acap-vapix`
- Backend: `vapixAcapDeploy.js` handles VAPIX calls

### Error Handling
- Connection timeouts
- Auth failures
- Upload errors
- Start failures
- All with user-friendly messages

## Testing the Complete Flow

1. **Run the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Authenticate** with Google
3. **Select project**
4. **At ACAP Deploy step**:
   - Latest release auto-loads
   - Click "Discover Cameras"
   - Set credentials (root/password)
   - Click "Deploy"
   - After success, click "Open Camera Apps"
   - You'll be taken directly to the camera's app management page

The deployment is now fully functional with proper VAPIX implementation, architecture detection, and direct camera interface access!
