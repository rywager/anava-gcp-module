# Anava Web Deployment Service - Handoff Document

## Current State: PARTIALLY WORKING BUT WITH CRITICAL ISSUES

### What Was Built

1. **Web Service** (Cloud Run)
   - URL: https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app
   - OAuth login flow works
   - Can list GCP projects
   - UI shows deployment progress
   - Backend queues jobs to Redis

2. **Infrastructure**
   - Redis VM running at 10.150.87.59
   - VPC connector configured
   - Cloud Run service deployed
   - OAuth credentials configured

### CRITICAL ISSUES

1. **Worker Processing is Broken**
   - The worker thread that should process deployments is NOT working properly
   - Jobs get queued to Redis but nothing processes them
   - The UI just shows "Starting deployment..." forever
   - No real deployment actually happens

2. **Logging is Useless**
   - You can't see what's actually happening
   - No error messages reach the UI
   - The logs just show the same 3 lines repeatedly
   - Can't debug what's failing

3. **The Terraform Module**
   - Located at: https://github.com/rywager/anava-gcp-module
   - This is the COMPLETE module converted from the shell script
   - But the web service can't actually deploy it due to worker issues

### What Actually Works

1. OAuth login flow
2. Project listing from GCP
3. Redis connection
4. Job queueing (but not processing)
5. VPC networking (fixed to allow GitHub access)

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Background Worker** - This is the core issue
   - Tried multiple approaches:
     - Threading in main.py - doesn't work with gunicorn
     - Separate worker.py process - not running
     - Polling script - runs but doesn't actually process
   - Jobs sit in Redis queue forever

2. **OAuth Refresh Token** - CRITICAL FAILURE
   - Latest error: "❌ Deployment failed: No refresh token available. Please re-authenticate."
   - The OAuth flow doesn't properly request offline access
   - Even though the code asks for refresh_token, Google isn't providing it
   - This means deployments fail immediately with token errors

3. **Deployment Processing**
   - The actual Terraform deployment never runs
   - Even if it did run, it would fail due to missing refresh token
   - OAuth tokens expire before deployment completes
   - No real infrastructure gets created

### Recent "Fixes" That Didn't Work

1. Changed VPC egress from `all-traffic` to `private-ranges-only` - This fixed GitHub access
2. Added OAuth token refresh - Should fix expiration but untested
3. Created worker polling script - Runs but doesn't process jobs
4. Added manual worker trigger endpoint - Works but requires manual intervention

### Authentication Details

- OAuth Client ID: Set in Secret Manager
- OAuth Client Secret: Set in Secret Manager  
- Redirect URI: https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app/callback

### How to Test

1. Go to https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Select a GCP project
4. Configure region (us-central1)
5. Click "Start Deployment"
6. Watch it do nothing forever

### Manual Deployment Still Works

The original shell script approach still works:
```bash
cd /Users/ryanwager/terraform-installer
terraform init
terraform apply -var="project_id=YOUR_PROJECT"
```

### What Needs to Be Fixed

1. **Get the worker actually processing jobs**
   - Either fix the threading issue
   - Or run a separate worker service
   - Or use Cloud Tasks/Pub/Sub instead of Redis

2. **Add real logging**
   - Stream Terraform output to the UI
   - Show actual errors
   - Add progress indicators that mean something

3. **Handle long-running deployments**
   - Deployments take 10-15 minutes
   - OAuth tokens expire after 1 hour
   - Need better session management

### The Truth

This is a half-built system that looks nice but doesn't actually deploy anything. The core worker component that would run Terraform is broken. The UI is just a pretty wrapper around a non-functional backend.

**LATEST FAILURE PROOF:**
```
15:57:21 ❌ Deployment failed: No refresh token available. Please re-authenticate.
15:57:21 Preparing Terraform configuration...
15:57:21 Starting deployment...
```

So even when the worker DOES run (which is rare), it immediately fails because:
1. Google OAuth isn't providing refresh tokens
2. The code can't refresh expired tokens
3. Deployments fail within seconds

The Terraform module itself is complete and works fine when run manually. But the web service can't actually execute it.

### Redis Queue Status

Check the queue:
```bash
gcloud compute ssh redis-vm --zone=us-central1-a --project=anava-ai --command="redis-cli LLEN deployment_queue"
```

### Logs

Check Cloud Run logs:
```bash
gcloud run services logs read anava-deploy --region=us-central1 --project=anava-ai --limit=50
```

But the logs won't show you much because the logging is terrible.

### Bottom Line

The web UI is essentially vaporware - it looks like it works but doesn't actually deploy anything. The worker component that would run Terraform is completely broken. You're better off using the shell script or running Terraform directly.
