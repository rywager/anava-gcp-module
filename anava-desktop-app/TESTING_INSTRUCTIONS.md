# Deployment Testing Instructions

## Current Status ‚úÖ

1. **Billing Check Fixed**: The app now uses storage bucket creation to verify billing (no Cloud Billing API required)
2. **UI Updates Working**: Project selection triggers billing check dynamically
3. **Deployment Monitor Running**: Background script monitoring all deployment attempts

## Test Files Created

### 1. `monitor-deployment.sh` (Currently Running)
- Monitors the Electron logs in real-time
- Tracks billing checks, deployment starts, progress, and completion
- Results saved to `deployment-results/` folder

### 2. `auto-deploy-test.js`
- Browser console script to automate UI interactions
- Can be pasted into DevTools console to test deployment flow
- Currently set to NOT click deploy (for safety)

### 3. `test-deployment-flow.js`
- Puppeteer-based test automation (requires `npm install puppeteer`)
- Runs multiple deployment iterations with 20-minute timeout
- Takes screenshots at each step

### 4. `test-deployment-electron.js`
- Electron-based test automation
- Runs within the Electron app context

## How to Run Tests

### Option 1: Manual Testing with Monitoring (Recommended)
```bash
# The monitor is already running! Check its output:
tail -f deployment-results/monitor-*.log

# In the app:
1. Select project "testies123" or "ryanwillfinishthis"
2. Watch console for billing check logs
3. Proceed through steps to Deploy Infrastructure
4. Monitor will track the deployment progress
```

### Option 2: Semi-Automated Browser Console Test
```bash
# In the Electron app DevTools console:
1. Open DevTools (should be open already)
2. Copy and paste contents of auto-deploy-test.js
3. Watch it navigate through the UI
4. Uncomment the deploy line to actually trigger deployment
```

### Option 3: Full Puppeteer Automation
```bash
# Install puppeteer first
npm install puppeteer

# Run the test (will retry 3 times with 20-min timeout each)
node test-deployment-flow.js
```

## What's Being Monitored

The monitoring script tracks:
- üîç Billing checks (successful bucket creation = billing enabled)
- üöÄ Deployment starts
- üìä Terraform progress updates
- ‚úÖ Successful completions
- ‚ùå Errors and failures
- üåê API Gateway URLs (indicates successful infrastructure)

## Current Deployment Status

From the logs, I can see:
- Project: `ryanwillfinishthis`
- Billing Status: ‚úÖ Enabled (bucket test passed)
- Terraform: Started at 11:40:20
- Working Directory: `/var/folders/xc/v68gqzmj5n91qw21s8mc093r0000gn/T/anava-terraform-1753029620440`

## Expected Deployment Timeline

1. **Init Phase**: ~1-2 minutes
2. **Plan Phase**: ~2-3 minutes  
3. **Apply Phase**: ~15-20 minutes
4. **Total Time**: ~20-25 minutes

## Checking Results

```bash
# View monitoring results
cat deployment-results/monitor-*.log | grep -E "(DEPLOYMENT|SUCCESS|FAILED|ERROR)"

# Check latest Electron logs
tail -100 /Users/ryanwager/Library/Logs/anava-vision-desktop/main.log | grep -i terraform

# See if API Gateway was created (success indicator)
tail -100 /Users/ryanwager/Library/Logs/anava-vision-desktop/main.log | grep -i "api.*gateway.*url"
```

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check for specific error in monitor logs
2. Common issues:
   - GCP quota limits
   - Permission issues (check service account roles)
   - API enablement delays
   - Network timeouts

The monitoring will continue running and will capture multiple deployment attempts!
