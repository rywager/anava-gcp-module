## Deployment Process

### 1. Prerequisites Verification ‚úÖ
```bash
# Cloud infrastructure deployed
cd /Users/ryanwager/terraform-installer/worktrees/camera-provisioning
terraform output -json > ../../anava-camera-manager/outputs.json

# Web service operational
curl https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app/health

# Camera network accessible
ping 192.168.50.156
```

### 2. Camera Manager Setup ‚úÖ
```bash
cd /Users/ryanwager/terraform-installer/anava-camera-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build application
npm run build

# Test camera discovery
node test-discovery.js

# Run integration tests
node test-camera-integration.js
```

### 3. Configuration Management ‚úÖ
The system supports multiple configuration sources:
1. **Terraform Outputs** (outputs.json)
2. **Environment Variables**
3. **Cloud API** (via deployment ID)
4. **Default Configuration**

Sample ACAP configuration created at: `sample-acap-config.json`

### 4. ACAP Deployment Workflow

#### A. Zero-Config Bootstrap
1. Camera powers on and gets network address
2. ACAP contacts enrollment endpoint
3. Receives configuration including:
   - Firebase credentials
   - API endpoints
   - Certificate authority
   - MCP server details

#### B. Authentication Flow
1. Camera authenticates with device-auth function
2. Receives Firebase custom token
3. Exchanges token via Token Vending Machine
4. Gets Google Cloud credentials

#### C. MCP Integration
1. Camera connects to MCP WebSocket server
2. Establishes bidirectional communication
3. Enables chat interface functionality
4. Supports skill deployment

### 5. Testing Results

#### Integration Test Summary:
- ‚úÖ Web Service Health Check
- ‚ùå Camera VAPIX Access (authentication issue)
- ‚úÖ Configuration Loading
- ‚úÖ ACAP Deployment Simulation
- ‚úÖ MCP Integration Configuration

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

### 1. Camera Authentication
```bash
# Option 1: Update camera credentials
# Access camera web interface and set known credentials

# Option 2: Factory reset camera
# Use physical reset button, then reconfigure

# Option 3: Use different test camera
# Ensure credentials are documented
```

### 2. Deploy via Web UI
1. Navigate to https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app
2. Sign in with Google (OAuth)
3. Click "Deploy Infrastructure"
4. Wait for deployment completion
5. Download deployment configuration

### 3. Camera Manager Deployment
```bash
# With correct camera credentials:
# Update test-discovery.js with actual credentials
# Run camera discovery
node test-discovery.js

# Start Electron app (requires display)
npm start

# Or use headless deployment
node deploy-headless.js <camera-ip> <username> <password>
```

### 4. Validate End-to-End Flow

#### A. ACAP Installation
- Upload ACAP to camera via VAPIX
- Configure with deployment credentials
- Start ACAP service
- Monitor logs for bootstrap

#### B. Chat Interface Test
- Select deployed camera in manager
- Open chat interface
- Test queries:
  - "What do you see?"
  - "Describe the scene"
  - "Is anyone present?"

#### C. Skill Deployment
- Use chat to create skills:
  - "Create a skill to detect motion"
  - "Alert when someone enters"
  - "Monitor this area for safety"

#### D. Event Streaming
- Verify events flow to Firestore
- Check Cloud Functions processing
- Monitor real-time updates

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify credentials match camera config
   - Check for IP filtering/firewall
   - Try both basic and digest auth

2. **Network Unreachable**
   - Confirm same network segment
   - Check VLAN configuration
   - Verify routing tables

### Deployment Issues
1. **ACAP Upload Fails**
   - Check camera storage space
   - Verify firmware compatibility
   - Review VAPIX error logs

2. **Configuration Errors**
   - Validate JSON syntax
   - Check API endpoint URLs
   - Verify certificates

### Integration Issues
1. **MCP Connection Failed**
   - Check WebSocket URL
   - Verify authentication tokens
   - Review firewall rules

2. **No Chat Response**
   - Ensure ACAP is running
   - Check MCP server logs
   - Verify network connectivity

## Security Considerations

1. **Credentials Management**
   - Never commit credentials to git
   - Use Secret Manager for sensitive data
   - Rotate certificates regularly

2. **Network Security**
   - Use VPN for remote access
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Enable HTTPS only

3. **Access Control**
   - OAuth for web interface
   - Certificate auth for cameras
   - IAM roles for cloud resources

## Performance Optimization

1. **Deployment Batching**
   - Deploy to multiple cameras in parallel
   - Adjust concurrency based on network
   - Monitor resource usage

2. **Event Processing**
   - Use Cloud Functions for scaling
   - Implement event batching
   - Cache frequently accessed data

## Monitoring & Logging

1. **Application Logs**
   - Camera Manager: Electron console
   - ACAP: Camera system logs
   - Cloud: Cloud Logging

2. **Metrics**
   - Deployment success rate
   - Camera online status
   - Event processing latency

3. **Alerts**
   - Camera offline
   - Deployment failures
   - Service errors
