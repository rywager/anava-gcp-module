# Agent Coordination Center

## Current Status
- **Target**: Fix API Gateway URL showing "Not found" 
- **Version**: v2.3.41 deployed
- **Project**: RyanClean (ryanclean) - ALWAYS USE THIS PROJECT
- **Fix Applied**: Removed invalid data source, using `google_api_gateway_gateway.anava_gateway.default_hostname` directly

## Active Deployment
- **Status**: RUNNING
- **Started**: 2025-07-16 14:24 UTC
- **Phase**: Enabling APIs (21 of 21 APIs enabled)
- **Expected**: Should progress to Terraform phase where API Gateway URL fix will be tested

## Agent Assignments
1. **LOG_MONITOR_AGENT**: Monitor Cloud Run logs for errors and deployment progress
2. **FIX_DEPLOY_AGENT**: Analyze errors and deploy fixes
3. **PUPPETEER_AGENT**: Monitor web interface and run tests

## Critical Rules
- **NEVER** use any project other than RyanClean (ryanclean)
- **ALWAYS** check this file before starting work
- **UPDATE** this file after any significant finding or action

## Known Issues History
- v2.3.38: Tried `default_hostname` directly - failed (attribute doesn't exist)
- v2.3.39: Added data source with wrong parameters - failed  
- v2.3.40: Fixed data source parameters - failed (data source doesn't exist)
- v2.3.41: **CURRENT FIX** - Use resource attribute directly (should work)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor current deployment progress
2. Check if API Gateway URL is properly output
3. If still failing, investigate what attribute is actually available on the resource

## Communication Protocol
- Each agent updates their section below with timestamp
- Share findings immediately
- Coordinate fixes before deploying

## LOG_MONITOR_AGENT Updates
**Latest update: 2025-07-16 14:52 UTC**

### Current Status:
- **Deployment Evidence**: Found API Gateway creation logs at 14:43 UTC showing v2.3.41 deployment attempt
- **Log Analysis**: "Resource already exists" errors indicate Terraform is progressing through existing resources
- **Cloud Run Status**: No active anava-deploy service currently running
- **Key Finding**: API Gateway creation attempted with "Resource 'projects/ryanclean/locations/global/apis/anava-api' already exists" message

### Deployment Timeline:
- 14:43:06 UTC: Service account creation attempts (already exists)
- 14:43:12 UTC: Storage bucket creation attempts (already exists) 
- 14:43:16 UTC: API Gateway creation attempt (already exists)
- 14:43:16 UTC: Secret Manager resources (already exists)

### Analysis:
- The deployment appears to have stalled after encountering existing resources
- No deployment completion logs found
- No active Cloud Run service indicates deployment may have failed or not reached completion
- Need to check if Terraform apply completed successfully despite "already exists" messages

### Next Action Required:
- Check if the deployment service is running in a different region/project
- Verify if the API Gateway URL output was generated
- Monitor for any new deployment attempts

### Follow-up Check (14:55 UTC):
- **API Gateway Status**: Found anava-api in ACTIVE state
- **Gateway Status**: No gateways found (may indicate incomplete deployment)
- **Terraform State**: No outputs available, suggests deployment didn't complete
- **Recent Activity**: Long-running operations check at 14:48 UTC (service enablement monitoring)
- **Assessment**: Deployment appears to have stalled after creating API but before creating gateway

### Monitoring Status: ACTIVE
- Checking for new logs every 2-3 minutes
- No new deployment activity detected since 14:48 UTC
- Need to alert FIX_DEPLOY_AGENT that deployment appears incomplete
