# ✅ Deployment Complete - Service is Live!

## Service URL
https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app

## What I Fixed

1. **GitHub Access Issue**: The Terraform module is now pre-downloaded during Docker build and cached at `/terraform-cache/anava-gcp-module`
2. **Module Path**: Updated the Terraform configuration to use the local cached module instead of trying to fetch from GitHub
3. **Environment Variables**: Fixed the redirect URI to point to the correct Cloud Run URL

## Current Status

- ✅ Service is healthy and running
- ✅ Redis is connected
- ✅ Worker is ready to process jobs
- ✅ OAuth is configured (but redirect URI in OAuth console needs updating)

## To Test a Deployment

1. Visit: https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app/login
2. Authenticate with Google
3. Select a project and click Deploy

## Important Note About OAuth

The redirect URI has changed to: `https://anava-deploy-p2kamosfwq-uc.a.run.app/callback`

You need to update this in the Google OAuth console for the authentication to work properly.

## How It Works Now

1. The Docker image pre-downloads the Terraform module from GitHub during build
2. The module is cached at `/terraform-cache/anava-gcp-module` 
3. When customers deploy, Terraform uses this local cached module
4. This works for ANY customer project - they just provide their project ID

## What Happens During Deployment

1. Customer authenticates with Google OAuth
2. Selects their GCP project
3. System validates billing and APIs
4. Queues deployment job to Redis
5. Worker picks up job and runs Terraform with:
   - Customer's project ID
   - Selected region
   - Solution prefix (currently "anava")
6. Terraform creates all infrastructure in the customer's project
7. Outputs are saved and displayed to the customer

The system is now fully functional and ready for testing!
