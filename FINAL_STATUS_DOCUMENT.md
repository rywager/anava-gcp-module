# Anava Web Deployment Service - Final Status Report

## Executive Summary

The web service appears to work but **deployments hang indefinitely** at "Initializing Terraform...". The UI shows it's running but nothing is actually happening.

## Current Deployment Status

**Deployment ID**: 85f769c3-e4a3-4e85-8779-f76046383499
**Started**: 16:02:29
**Current Status**: Shows "running" but is actually hung/frozen
**Last Log Entry**: "Initializing Terraform..."

## What Actually Happened

1. User logged in successfully
2. Selected project and started deployment
3. Job was queued to Redis
4. Worker picked up the job
5. Worker started processing:
   - ✅ "Starting deployment..."
   - ✅ "Preparing Terraform configuration..."
   - ✅ "Refreshed OAuth token"
   - ✅ "Initializing Terraform..."
   - ❌ **HUNG HERE - No progress for 5+ minutes**

## Root Causes

### 1. Terraform Init Hanging
- The `terraform init` command is hanging indefinitely
- No timeout was set in the code
- The worker thread is blocked waiting for the process
- Likely trying to download providers/modules and timing out

### 2. Logging Architecture is Broken
- Logs are written to Redis: `deployment_logs:{deployment_id}`
- But Redis VM is not accessible via SSH
- UI only shows Redis logs, not console output
- Real errors/progress are invisible to users

### 3. Worker Thread Blocking
- Single worker thread handles all deployments
- When one deployment hangs, no others can process
- No way to cancel or timeout stuck deployments

## Recent Fix Attempts

### Revision 00034-9sk
- Added `prompt='consent'` to OAuth flow to get refresh tokens
- This fixed the "No refresh token available" error

### Revision 00035-cxj (Latest)
- Added console logging to debug Terraform issues
- Added 5-minute timeout to Terraform commands
- Added verbose error logging

**BUT**: The hung deployment is still using the old code without timeouts

## Service Architecture

```
Cloud Run (https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app)
├── main.py (Flask app)
├── start_worker.sh (Polls /api/worker/process every 5 seconds)
└── /api/worker/process endpoint
    └── Processes one job from Redis queue
        └── Runs Terraform in temp directory

Redis (10.150.87.59)
├── deployment_queue (job queue)
├── deployment_logs:{id} (log storage)
└── deployment_outputs:{id} (results storage)

Firestore
└── deployments collection (status tracking)
```

## Critical Issues

1. **No Visibility**: Can't see what Terraform is actually doing
2. **No Timeouts**: Processes hang forever (fixed in latest revision)
3. **No Redis Access**: Can't debug or view actual logs
4. **Single Thread**: One hung deployment blocks everything
5. **No Cancellation**: Can't stop a hung deployment

## Files and Code

- `/Users/ryanwager/terraform-installer/web-service/cloud-run/main.py` - Main Flask app
- `/Users/ryanwager/terraform-installer/web-service/cloud-run/start_worker.sh` - Worker polling script
- `/Users/ryanwager/terraform-installer/main.tf` - Complete Terraform module
- `https://github.com/rywager/anava-gcp-module` - Published module repository

## Environment Variables

```
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=anava-ai
REDIS_HOST=10.150.87.59
REDIRECT_URI=https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app/callback
```

## VPC Configuration

- Connector: `anava-deploy-connector`
- Egress: `private-ranges-only` (allows GitHub access)

## How to Debug

1. Check Cloud Run logs:
```bash
gcloud run services logs read anava-deploy --region=us-central1 --project=anava-ai --limit=100
```

2. Check if Redis is accessible:
```bash
curl -s https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app/health | jq
```

3. Manually trigger worker:
```bash
curl -X POST https://anava-deploy-392865621461.us-central1.run.app/api/worker/process
```

## The Real Problem

The service infrastructure works (OAuth, Redis, Worker, UI) but **Terraform init hangs** when running in Cloud Run. This could be due to:

1. Network restrictions despite VPC fix
2. Git authentication issues
3. Provider download timeouts
4. Missing git credentials for private repos

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Add streaming logs** - Don't rely on Redis, stream directly to UI
2. **Debug Terraform init** - Run with `-input=false` and verbose logging
3. **Add proper timeouts** - Already done in latest revision
4. **Test locally first** - Ensure Terraform works in container
5. **Use Cloud Build** - Instead of running Terraform in Cloud Run
6. **Add health checks** - Detect and restart hung workers

## Manual Workaround

The Terraform module works perfectly when run manually:
```bash
cd /Users/ryanwager/terraform-installer
terraform init
terraform apply -var="project_id=YOUR_PROJECT"
```

## Summary

The web service is 90% working but fails at the critical step - actually running Terraform. The latest deployment has been "running" for 8+ minutes but is actually hung at `terraform init`. The UI looks professional but can't show what's really happening because the logging architecture relies on an inaccessible Redis VM.
